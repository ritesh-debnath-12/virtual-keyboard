# Virtual Keyboard âŒ¨

## What is it? ðŸ¤”

Just a simple virtual keyboard which imitates your keypresses...that's all

NOTE: This only works for desktops/laptops. I don't know how this will work for mobiles, and I have no plans to implement as such.

## Installation âš™
### Check for dependencies:

1) Make sure you have **git** installed and added on PATH.
   
   - You can check by opening a terminal(CMD/Powershell/MinTTY etc) and typing in it:
     ```bash
     git -v
     ```
   - If it shows you the version(eg. git version 2.45.1.windows.1), you are good to go!
2) Make sure you have **Node and NPM** installed and added on PATH.
   
   - You can check by opening a terminal(CMD/Powershell/MinTTY etc) and typing in it:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
     AND
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```
   - If these work, you are good to go!
3) Make sure you have **Python and pip** installed and added on PATH.

      AND
      ```bash
      pip --version
      ```
   - If these work, and you don't get some scary red text, you are good to go!

## After Installation...ðŸ˜…

If your keyboard is all over the place, here are two ways to fix it:
1) Press **Ctrl and then scroll down**.
                 OR
2) Press **Ctrl and then press - on your numpad**.

I apologize for the problems, but as of now, I have no idea how to fix this... ðŸ˜­
