# Virtual Keyboard âŒ¨

## What is it? ðŸ¤”
Just a simple virtual keyboard which imitates your keypresses...that's all

NOTE: This only works for desktops/laptops. I don't know how this will work for mobiles, and I have no plans to implement as such.

## Installation âš™
Follow these steps: 
**ALERT: INSTALLATION SETUPS HAVE BEEN CHANGED. I WILL UPDATE THE STEPS AS SOON AS I FREE**

1) Make sure you have git installed and added on PATH.
2) Make sure you have node installed and added on PATH.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ritesh-debnath-12/virtual-keyboard
cd virtual-keyboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it! Now open your browser and visit localhost at port 5173

## After Installation...ðŸ˜…
If your keyboard is all over the place, here are two ways to fix it:
1) Press **Ctrl and then scroll down**.
                 OR
2) Press **Ctrl and then press - on your numpad**.

I apologize for the problems, but as of now, I have no idea how to fix this... ðŸ˜­
## TO-DO ðŸ“ƒ
- Readonly text area which will contain the keypresses
- Special keys(Space, Backspace, Tab, Caps Lock etc)
- Send a text file to you regarding what you have written.
